# City-Game
Welcome to the city game!

This game was created to help GCSE geography students gain more background knowledge on how different types of cities are built,
to help them understand their case studies in greater detail (for my A level computing project), however it can be played by anyone of course!
No previous knowledge is needed, there is just a small quiz at the end to test how much you know about the city you will end up building.
The game should be self explanitory, but if there is anything you are confused about when playing check in the user guide - which should contain
any information needed to get run the program (as well as a detailed description of the game mechanics and some tips)

To get started extract the executable.zip
